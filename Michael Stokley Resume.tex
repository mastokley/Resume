\section{Profile}
Software developer. I'm patient enough to take difficult projects seriously, and
driven enough to automate tedious, needlessly manual work. In my previous
accounting position, I exceeded expectations by learning SQL to automate my data
entry / data quality tasks (and avoid using a cumbersome GUI). Since then, I
have spent two years studying math, computer science, and statistics at North
Seattle College, attended Code Fellows' Python Development Intensive (taught by
esteemed pythonista Cris Ewing). I've been working as a foundational member of
the engineering team at iDatalabs, building out a customer facing web portal
with Vue.js, Flask, and PostgreSQL. My goals for 2018: learn more diverse
languages (e. g. functional, typed, low-level, or systems); learn to handle
asynchrony without callbacks (using, for example, channels found in Go or
Clojure); blog about design patterns; work through a few more chapters of SICP.

{2017.01 - present}
{iDatalabs}
{Full Stack Engineer}
{}
{Bellevue, WA}
{I built and currently maintain a Vue.js single page application that displays and sells
  marketing data; I also maintain and update the consumed api, written in Flask
  (Python) as well as migrate underlying db schema to fit api requirements as
  needed. I work on and debug all tiers of the architecture, from UI to backend,
  to our Postgres and Mongo databases, to the various Apache and Nginx servers
  deployed across Azure instances.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Designed and implemented a 'store' to manage client-side shared state
  \item Optimized perceived page performance, including both frontend and
    backend optimizations
  \item Knocked up internal admin dashboards in Flask as needed
  \end{itemize}}

\cventry {2016.08 - 2016.10} {Red Mountain Software} {Freelance Web Developer}
{} {Seattle, WA}
{Designed, built, and tested an internal management application
  according to client specification. Carefully designed and implemented database
  schema to fit domain-specific business objects. App built with Django and PostgreSQL, with
  jQuery on the front as needed.}

\cventry {2016.07 - 2016.09} {Sternshus, Inc} {Co-founding Software Developer}
{}
{Seattle, WA}
{Provided front-end solutions in the context of rapidly
  changing business requirements. Worked primarily in Webflow, Django, and
  MySQL. I am most proud of having written sed and python scripts to automate
  merging Webflow files into the larger Django project.
}

\cventry {2012.04 - 2015.04} {Cleanscapes} {AR Specialist} {} {Seattle, WA}
{Wrote and maintained a library of accurate, sophisticated SQL queries to
  capture evolving data inconsistencies; these queries eliminated 37.5 labor
  hours per month despite a 126\% increase in customer accounts over a two year
  period
